  <h1>Telemetry and Analytics Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Overview.</strong> This application may collect <strong>anonymous</strong> analytics to improve gameplay and balance. No personally identifiable information (PII) is collected or stored in analytics.</p>
  <h2>Data we collect (when you accept)</h2>
  <p>Event types: story outcomes, node visits, choice selections, combat outcomes. Session summary: aggregated counts and timestamps. We do not collect names, emails, account IDs, or IP addresses in analytics.</p>
  <h2>Consent</h2>
  <p>Analytics are off until you choose Accept. You can withdraw consent from the main menu (Telemetry section). Withdrawing stops new data from being sent.</p>
  <h2>Retention &amp; your rights</h2>
  <p>Aggregated statistics may be retained as needed. Raw events may be limited (e.g. 90 days). We do not store PII in analytics, so we cannot attribute data to individual users. For erasure or questions, contact the operator.</p>
