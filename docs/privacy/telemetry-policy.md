# Telemetry and Analytics Policy

## Overview

This application may collect **anonymous** analytics to improve gameplay and balance (e.g. outcome rates, popular choices, session length). No personally identifiable information (PII) is collected or stored in analytics.

## Data We Collect (when you accept)

- **Event types:** Story outcomes (e.g. chapter completed, ending reached, run failed), node visits, choice selections, and combat outcomes.
- **Session summary:** Aggregated counts per session (e.g. number of choices, outcomes), session start/end timestamps.
- **No:** Names, emails, account IDs, IP addresses, or other identifiers are sent to analytics.

## Consent

- Analytics are **off** until you choose **Accept** in the consent banner.
- You can **withdraw consent** at any time from the main menu (Telemetry section: "Withdraw consent"). Withdrawing stops any new data from being sent; previously sent data may remain in aggregated form on our servers.
- Declining or withdrawing does not affect game functionality.

## Retention

- Aggregated statistics may be retained for as long as needed to operate and improve the service.
- Raw event data may be retained for a limited period (e.g. 90 days) before aggregation or deletion, depending on backend configuration.

## Your Rights (e.g. GDPR)

- **Access:** You may request a summary of analytics data related to your usage; because we do not store PII in analytics, we cannot attribute data to individual users.
- **Erasure:** Withdrawing consent stops future collection. Requesting erasure of existing aggregated data may be possible via contact with the operator.
- **Portability:** Aggregated stats are not personal data; we do not provide data portability for anonymous analytics.

## Changes

We may update this policy. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance. Last updated: 2025.
